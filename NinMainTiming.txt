Magic: magic marker.
Sub: Some type of subtype indicator.
ID: The id of target client. If the packet is a broadcast to all clients this will be set to zero
Counter: big-endian. If ID is zero then counter will be zero (broadcast?)
ms1: Local time in millseconds truncated to 16bit short big-endian
ms2: Remote time in millseconds truncated to 16bit short big-endian if ID is zero then this will be zero too.
Flags: No clue what this is used for. 
Slot: The lobby slot the player is occupying. Initial connection player will try for slot 2 for some reason.
Size: Length of the payload minus the overhead as big-endian.
NNID: Global numerical id for user on Nintendo's network.
Type: Payload type.
HMAC: Used to validate and sign the packet. This used to be 128 bits but is now 96 bits.
